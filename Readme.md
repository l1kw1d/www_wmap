# WMAP Demo App

The web app is developed under Ruby on Rails framework, in order to showcase the basic usage of the wmap library. To explore further and utilize the full power of wmap library, please refer to the Documents section.


### Tech

WMAP Demo App uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [Ruby on Rails] - A web-application framework that includes everything!
* [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
* [wmap](https://github.com/yangsec888/wmap) - Web Mapper gem of course
* [devise] - Rails app authentication and user session management solution

WMAP Demo App is open source with a [www_wmap] project on GitHub.

### Local Installation

WMAP Demo App requires [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org) v4.2+ and [Mysql](https://www.mysql.com/) database to run.

Install the environment dependencies, and ensure the database server is running. For example, in our Linux / Mac laptop,

```sh
$ cd www_wmap
$ bundle install
$ rake db:create
$ rake db:migration
$ rails server
```

### Free Cloud Deployment

It would be also easy to deploy the application to cloud. Here are the example based on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) and [GitHub](https://github.com). You can use your favorite repository and web hosting service. For the benefit of the most users, we will do it using the web dashboard for those non technical sophisticate users.  But if you are a IT specialist, it is your call to fly in CLI mode.

Our Example:
First of all, you need to register a [GitHub](https://github.com) account and a [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) account first.
 1. Login you GitHub account, start a project, enter Repository name and Description (optional).
 2. Choose import code from another repository, enter Your old repositoryâ€™s clone URL with "https://github.com/yangsec888/www_wmap.git" which is the web URL of Online Quiz on the GitHub. You can also visit it on the GitHub and see the URL via "Clone or Download" button.
 3. Click begin import and wait until GitHub showing "Importing complete! Your new repository XXX/YYY is ready." For now you already have stored the source codes on your own GitHub.
 4. Next, we are going to deploy it on the Heroku. It is quite easy and straightforward since we can connect Heroku with GitHub.
 5. Login you Heroku account, create a new app, choose GitHub as Deployment method in the Deploy tab of apps in the Heroku Dashboard.
 6. You will need to use GitHub credential to connect this app to GitHub to enable code diffs and deploy.
 7. After successful connection, you can see your Github username in repository selections before repo-name which you need to put your repository name in Github, then search and connect the right project.
 8. Before we manually deploy it using master branch, we need to add ClearDB MySQL Database on our App. In the Resources tab of apps in the Heroku Dashboard, search ClearDB MySQL in Add-ons and provision. You will need to add your payment information but the free plan is sufficient for us.  [cleardb installation reference.](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/cleardb)
 9. After add on  cleardb is successfully installed, we need to do some settings in the Settings tab. Add below two links to Buildpacks.
  * https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-ruby
  * https://github.com/gunpowderlabs/buildpack-ruby-rake-deploy-tasks
10. In Config Variables
* Change "CLEARDB_DATABASE_URL" value from "mysql://xyz" to "mysql2://xyz"
* Add [key]DEPLOY_TASKS => [value]db:migrate db:seed
* Add [key]DATABASE_URL => [value] same value as CLEARDB_DATABASE_URL
11. Finally, Go back to Deploy tab and click Deploy Branch "master" in manually at the bottom. Once deploy, you can open your Online Quiz App to examine. *Congratulations!*

### Usage
Under the home page, click on "Start" button to start. Follow the on-screen instructions, in order to launch a successfully WMAP discovery. The discovery result should be tracked under the "Discovery" menu tab.
